# Sample Efficient Learning of Predictors that Complement Humans
We provide two jupyter notebooks each replicates one of the figures in our paper:

- joint_v_staged_model_complex.ipynb replicates Figure 2
- joint_v_staged_sample_complexity.ipynb replicates Figure 3
- python run_halfspaces.py replicates Figure 4
